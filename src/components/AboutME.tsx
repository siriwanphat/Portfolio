                        <p>Hi, my name is Siriwan Phatsangwan. I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering (Computer Engineering, king Mongkut's institute of technology Ladkrabang).</p>
                        <p>
                            My degree course has prepared me well for this position. During my project about covid-19 using R language, I was required to do a lot of independent research,
                            which required self-motivation, and the ability to organize and work on a long-term project.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Introduction to Data Analytics course has helped prepare me by use python and jupyter notebooks for analyst and visualization and prediction data.
                    </p>
